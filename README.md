# ICL-1501 / Cogar C4 Disassembler

A C++ disassembler for the ICL-1501/Cogar C4 minicomputer that converts binary machine code to the original DPL-1 assembly language format.

The disassembler does not respect the orignal format of the DPL-1 assembly language as it is quite hard to read, but a more modern version.
